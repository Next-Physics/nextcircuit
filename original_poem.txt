**Whispers of Bloom**

In the hush of dawn, where the shadows retreat,  
Petals unravel in silken embrace,  
Each bloom a soft secret, each color a beat,  
Alive in the sunlight, a dancer in grace.

The rose unfolds dreams, its fragrance a sigh,  
Crimson like passion, brushed by the air,  
While daisies, like laughter, are scattered nearby,  
With faces to heaven, they whisper a prayer.

Lilies in ivory, pure as the night,  
Stand sentinel tall, a statement of peace,  
Their elegance sways in delicate light,  
As if guiding souls toward a moment of ease.

Violets, bashful, in corners they hide,  
With shyness and charm, they paint the cool ground,  
A tapestry woven in shadows so wide,  
In their soft-spoken language, a sweet love is found.

The sunflowers turn, with a gaze so divine,  
Chasing the warmth of the sky’s golden hue.  
With faces like suns, they remind us of time,  
Of hope’s gentle heartbeat, and skies ever blue.

Anemones dance with a tempest-like flair,  
In wild, vivid patches that beckon the eye,  
Their colors, a riot, a bold, breathless air,  
Echoing tales of the storms that went by.

Oh, how they evoke all the longings we keep,  
Each blossom a mirror reflecting our soul,  
With petals like whispers, in gardens we weep,  
For love that once was, for dreams that made whole.

So let us wander where wildflowers bloom,  
In meadows of memory, in gardens of grace,  
And gather the moments that flicker and fume,  
For within every flower, a universe waits—  
A breath of life written in petals, our fate.
