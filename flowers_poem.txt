**A Symphony of Blooms**

In gardens rich, where colors blend,  
The flowers dance, their petals bend,  
A tapestry of life unfolds,  
In whispered tales that nature tells.

Bright daffodils with golden crowns,  
Stand proud amidst the emerald gowns,  
While roses blush in crimson hue,  
Their velvet touch, a lover’s cue.

The lilac sighs in soft twilight,  
A fragrant breath, pure and light,  
In morning's dew, their essence glows,  
A fleeting kiss from heaven's prose.

Tulips burst with bold delight,  
In whispers of the day and night,  
A palette drawn from nature’s hand,  
Where every hue a story planned.

The gentle orchids, rare and fine,  
In secret gardens, subtly shine,  
With elegance that takes the breath,  
They weave the line ‘twixt life and death.

Each bloom, a chapter, vivid, grand,  
A testament to earth’s own hand,  
From every seed, a hope is sown,  
In fragrant fields, we find our own.

They mark the seasons, a graceful guide,  
Through summer's warmth and winter's tide,  
In joyful gatherings, they entwine,  
With hearts aflame, in love's design.

For every smile that blooms anew,  
A flower speaks of dreams in hue,  
They heal the soul, and oft remind,  
Of beauty found in every kind.

So let us honor, cherish, keep,  
These fleeting gifts that nature weeps,  
In every garden, wild or tamed,  
A symphony of blooms proclaimed.
